Threads hold ports
	Port can be allocated:	Port p = Port::Create(IPC Space, Right);
		IPC Space...
		Rights are stuff like Receive or Send
			Only one thread can hold receive right
	
	Every thread holds exception ports if desired:	Port p = Port::GetExceptionPort(Type);
		Exceptions are things like signals in POSIX
		Only Receive right
	
	Rights of already existing ports can be acquired:	Port p = Port::AcquireRight(Port, Right)

Ports itself are in fact message queues:
	Receive(&MSG);
	Send(&MSG);
	
Messages are nested structs with one header and several descriptors
	Those descriptors describe the contained data itself like port rights, data, ports etc.

How to acquire ports of other services?
	Talk to a special bootstrap-port and retrieve those ports and rights
	




TODO: Are those rights to acquire really necessary? Just fetch a port from the bootstrap server and there you go
	If you create a port, the creating thread gets receive rights
	If you retrieve a port, the retrieving thread gets send right
But... How can be controlled who speaks with whom? A mallicious attacker could just talk directly to the system servers. Bad!

What about an interrupt port for device drivers?
Timeouts for message sending? If queue is full?
