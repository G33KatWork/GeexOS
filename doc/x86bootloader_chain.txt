BIOS loads MBR to 0x7C00 in realmode
MBR relocates itself to 0x1FE0:0x7C00 (=0x9BE0)
MBR searches for active partition and loads first 512 Bytes to 0x7C00

First stage searches for file GXLDR and loads it to 0x800:0 (=0x8000)
while doing so, it copies the rootdir to 0x2000:0 (=0x20000) and the FAT to
the 2 continous segments 0x3000:0 and 0x4000:0

After loading, stage2 takes over.
The binary consists of a stub (stage 1.5) which switches to protected mode,
relocates the appended PE file to 0x100000 (=1MB), parses it, copies all
allocated sections to their locations and jumps into the entrypoint.
Relocations are not supported at this time.

The real stage 2 is linked to 0x9000.
