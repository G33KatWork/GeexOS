BIOS loads MBR to 0x7C00 in realmode
MBR relocates itself to 0x1FE0:0x7C00 (=0x9BE0)
MBR searches for active partition and loads first 512 Bytes to 0x7C00

First stage searches for file GXLDR and loads it to 0x800:0 (=0x8000)
while doing so, it copies the rootdir to 0x2000:0 (=0x20000) and the FAT to
the 2 continous segments 0x3000:0 and 0x4000:0

After loading, stage2 takes over.
The binary consists of a stub (stage 1.5) which switches to protected mode,
moves the appended PE file to 0x100000 (=1MB), parses it, copies all
allocated sections to their locations and jumps into the entrypoint.
Relocations are not supported at this time.

The real stage 2 is linked to 0x9000.
The stage uses a 4K buffer at 0x1000 for bios call results
The protected mode stack starts at 0x8000 and grows down 0x1000 Bytes.
The real mode stack for BIOS calls starts at 0x7000 and also grows down
0x1000 Bytes
