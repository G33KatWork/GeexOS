After bootloader:
Kernel gets loaded at 0x100000
2 Code-Sections: .setup is linked to 0x100000 and .text to 0xC0000000
.setup just contains our temporary GDT which can be thrown away after we
loaded our fancy gdt after we enabled paging for getting our kernel to the
upper half

start.S:
Our GDT from 0x100000 gets loaded which adds 0x40000000 to all our addresses.
After that we set our data segment registers and do a far jump to set the code
segment register to the index of the gdt descriptor, too.
Through this jump we are getting straight into the higher half:
Our next instruction is effectively still on the same position as the rest: 0x100000
But we told the linker to link our code to 0xC0000000. So we are now jumping somewhere
to 0xC0100000. Then our temporary GDT adds 0x40000000 to this value, the 32 bit value
flows over and e voila, we are again somewhere at 0x100000.
Now, we set up a stack and jump to our C-Routines

entry.c:
We just call the main function

main.c:
Here we need to setup the paging. We are calling init_paging() to do this.

arch/x86/paging.c:
Here we set up the page directory and the first pagetable which holds 4MB of allocated pages
for our kernel.
First we need to add 0x40000000 to the pointers, so that we get, again, somewhere to 0x100000.
Remember: Our temporary GDT is still active.
Next, we are mapping the lowest 1024 pages (4MB total) into the pagetable. Each entry in the
pagetable points to the beginning of a page (so it must be 4096 byte aligned).
Next, we write this pagetable to the page directory for the locations 0 to 4MB (0 to 0x400000)
and 3072 to 3076MB (0xC0000000 to 0xC0400000).
The very last step we need to perform is setting the pointer for the page directory into CR3
and enabling paging in Register CR0.
Now that paging is enabled, the MMU translates all 0xC0000000 or 0x0 addresses to 0x0 adresses
through the page directory.

arch/x86/gdt.c:
Now that we have our paging up and running, we can use our normal GDT now, which doesn't add
0x40000000 to all addresses automatically, since we have our MMU which translates our addresses.
Now, after we are using a normal GDT, we could remove all the pages at 0 to 4MB from the page
directory, since they are not needed anymore, what I haven't done yet.


Now we have a kernel running at 0xC0000000.
